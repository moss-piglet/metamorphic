Metamorphic is a privacy-focused connectivity platform. Designed to empower and insulate you against surveillance capitalism.

## Why do this?

Surveillance capitalism powers today's major social networks and their ecosystem of companies and applications. Our desire to connect has been hijacked and our very nature, and autonomy, is at stake in this unprecedented shift of power (just ask Australia).

Metamorphic is another choice for connecting online. A choice that empowers and protects you. Free from the surveillance and attention economy.

Privacy and security must be at the forefront of design, along with addiction-free features that won't steal you away from living and enjoying your life. Metamorphic is for you, not the other way around.

Metamorphic's business also contributes positively to its communities through revenue sharing with our partner organizations.
